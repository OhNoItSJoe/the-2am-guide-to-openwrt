# the-2am-guide-to-openwrt
This guide describes how to setup a pre-configured OpenWRT-Router to act as Router, WiFi-Accesspoint and Firewall.

## What the hell is OpenWRT?
In every router, there is a chip running linux and a custom interface of whatever manufacturer, AVM (Fritz!Box), Netgear, Asus, TP-Link, to just name a few of thousands.
OpenWRT is a completlty open source firmware and user interface that can do more than all of those together, because it can basically do whatever you want. If that's a good idea? That's something you have to decide.
Because Linux isn't free. You have to pay attention.
